# Consider a trial with 36 possible outcomes where each outcome has equal probability.  
# How many outcomes correspond to an event that has probability 1/9?

# 6 sided single die 
#for i in range(100):

## Question 5, They said rank but the available answers only work if they mean SUIT

# mean GPA of class if 30% have a 4.0, 40% have a 3.0, 20% have a 2.0, and 10% have a 1.0

# even vs odd in 6 sided die, lose if odd, win if even
num_even = 3

elif p_even < p_odd:
    print "Question 7: expected winnings are positive"

## Question 8: what is the expected value of trial(n) below: assume n is a positive integer - enter as math expression in n:

def trial(n):
    val = random.randrange(n)
    return val

# the arithmetric sum from 0 to k has a value of 0.5 * k * (k + 1). 
# expected value is the sum of the a single outcome * the probability of that outcome.
# the probability of a single outcome is:

n = 10 # lets do 10 for example
p_single_outcome = 1.0 / n

# Expected value is the arithmetric sum * probability of individual outcome because of uniform distribution
a_sum = 0.5 * n * (n + 1)
exp_value = a_sum / n

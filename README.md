# Principles_of_Computing_Rice

This is the Principles of Computing Class at Rice University.  I took this class on Coursera and am adding my projects to this repository.  If you are a student of this class, please be aware of the student academic integrity code.

If you are interested in running this code, copy and paste into [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org).  These programs should also be able to run in any version of Python 2 as well.

Starting with HW4, I started using Python 3.  To use the code, copy and past into [CodeSkulptor3](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/). As started earlier, these should also work with any version of Python 3.

# Principles_of_Computing_Rice

This is the Principles of Computing Class at Rice University.  I took this class on Coursera and am adding my projects to this repository.  If you are a student of this class, please be aware of the student integrity code-don't copy this code for your assignment.

If you are interested in running this code, copy and paste into [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org).  These programs should also be able to run in any version of Python 2, however, I have not tested this.

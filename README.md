# Principles_of_Computing_Rice

This is the Principles of Computing Class at Rice University.  I took this class on Coursera and am adding my projects to this repository.  If you are a student of this class, please be aware of the student integrity code. Don't copy this code for your assignment.

If you are interested in running this code, copy and paste into [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org).  These programs should also be able to run in any version of Python 2.
